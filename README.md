# 📊 Stack Overflow Post Analysis Challenge

This repository contains the solutions for the Newsela take-home challenge, focused on analyzing Stack Overflow posts. The tasks include analyzing tag performance, year-over-year trends for Python vs DBT, and identifying post qualities that correlate with higher answer and accepted answer rates.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

The challenge prompts were:

1. **Tag & Tag-Pair Analysis:**  
   Identify which tags lead to the most answers and highest accepted answer rates for the current year. Analyze both single tags and co-occurring tag pairs.

2. **Python vs DBT Year-over-Year:**  
   For posts tagged **only** with `python` or `dbt`, calculate year-over-year changes of question-to-answer ratio and accepted answer rate over the last 10 years. Compare Python to DBT.

3. **Post Strategic Metrics (Creative Analysis):**  
   Beyond tags, explore which question features correlate with higher answer and accepted answer rates. Feel free to be creative.

## 📊 Submissions Summary

### 1. Tag & Tag-Pair Performance
- **Folder:** `question_1_tag_performance`  
- **Query:** `stackoverflow_tag_analysis.sql`  
- Evaluates single tags and co-occurring tag pairs, ranked by average answers and accepted answer rate.

### 2. Python vs DBT Year-over-Year
- **Folder:** `question_2_python_dbt_trends`  
- **Query:** `stackoverflow_python_dbt_trends.sql`  
- Compares question-to-answer ratio and accepted answer rate over the last 10 years for Python vs DBT.

### 3. Strategic Metrics (Creative Analysis)
- **Folder:** `question_3_strategic_metrics`  
- **Query:** `stackoverflow_strategic_metrics.sql
- Assigns strategic categories to questions based on features like score, views, answer count, title length, and user reputation.  
- **Bonus:** As a creative extension for the challenge, a **Looker Studio dashboard** was built directly from the SQL table generated by this query, providing interactive visualizations and strategic insights: [StackOverflow Strategic Analysis](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/2aa2af5f-022b-4426-84cd-76c26efb066c/page/dsYeF).

## 🛠 Technical Approach Highlights

- Queries are optimized for **performance** and **readability**.  
- Aggregations and bucketization are used for clarity and extendability.  
- Division by zero handled with `SAFE_DIVIDE()`.  
- Queries designed to scan **source data efficiently**, minimizing bytes processed.  
- Data quality validated by cross-checking counts, averages, and consistency across buckets.

## ⚡ Performance & Cost (Examples)

| Query | Duration | Bytes Processed | Bytes Billed | Slot ms |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Tag & Tag-Pair Performance | 8 s | 1.27 GB | 1.27 GB | 581,426 |
| Python vs DBT YOY | 3 s | 1.27 GB | 1.27 GB | 151,856 |
| Strategic Metrics | 3 s | 2.43 GB | 2.44 GB | 151,856 |

- Optimized with pre-filtering, bucketing, and single-pass scans of the dataset.
- Aggregations reduce noise and improve analysis clarity.
- Safe calculations prevent division errors.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the question of interest.  
2. Inspect the SQL query (`queries/`) for logic and metrics calculation.  
3. For **Strategic Metrics**, explore the **bonus dashboard** built from the query table to interactively analyze question quality and engagement.
